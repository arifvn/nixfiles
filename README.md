# My Nix Configuration on MacOS & Ubuntu üñ•Ô∏è

## Prerequisite

- Install nix using [unofficial nix installer](https://zero-to-nix.com/).

```console
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

## Build

#### Darwin

1. Create `/run` directory as `nix-darwin` [needs](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin#Manual-install) it.

```console
printf 'run\tprivate/var/run\n' | sudo tee -a /etc/synthetic.conf
/System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/Contents/Resources/apfs.util -t
```

2. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```console
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Build and apply your configuration.

```console
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.arifvn.system
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#arifvn
```

4. Switch configuration.

- `drs` (to build and switch your configuration)
- `psc` (to build and cache your configuration)

#### Ubuntu

```console
nix build .#homeConfigurations.arifvn.activationPackage
./result/activate
```

## Possible Issues

#### Darwin

- `warning: failed to execute apfs.util`. If you encountered [it](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/issues/401), you might have needed to restart your machine.
- `warning: can't link /etc/shells` or `warning can't link /etc/nix/nix.conf`. You might get them saying that files under `/etc` can't be linked as they already exist. You'll need to delete those files and run `darwin-rebuild switch` again. It'd be good if you had those files backed up first, just in case.

```console
sudo cp /etc/shells /etc/shells.bak && sudo rm /etc/shells
sudo cp /etc/bashrc /etc/bashrc.bak && sudo rm /etc/bashrc
sudo cp /etc/nix/nix.conf /etc/nix/nix.conf.bak

nix build .#darwinConfigurations.arifvn.system --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#arifvn
```

- `command not found: darwin-rebuild`. Are nix and `darwin-rebuild` available in your shell if you open a new terminal and run `exec /run/current-system/sw/bin/fish`? If so, you might need to run `chsh` to set the default shell that terminal emulators on your system will use. Try running `chsh -s /run/current-system/sw/bin/fish` to set Fish as your default shell.

- Some system settings like Dock settings or Finder settings might only take effects after you reboot your machine.

- Some apps might need to be configured mannually afterward as they don't come up with configuration files including `android-studio`, `istat-menus` and `raycast`.

#### Ubuntu

‚úÖ None. It hasn't been found yet.
